# GitHub Actions Problem Matcher

[![CI](https://github.com/xt0rted/problem-matcher/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/xt0rted/problem-matcher/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![CodeQL](https://github.com/xt0rted/problem-matcher/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/xt0rted/problem-matcher/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml)

A GitHub Actions template to easily add or remove a problem matcher to workflows.

## Setup

This template has been designed so the only code change you should have to make is in [problem-matcher.json](/src/problem-matcher.json) and optionally the tests for it.
When editing the `problem-matcher.json` you should set the owner name to the application and/or report style being matched.
Examples of this are `eslint`, `eslint-compact`, or `eslint-stylish`.

Make sure to also update the `action.yml` and `package.json` files.

Sometimes report messages might not include a line or column number and your regular expression doesn't pick those lines up.
To help avoid those situations tests are provided to give coverage to the regular expression.

A useful resource to view and test your regular expression is [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/).

## Usage

```yml
on: push
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: xt0rted/problem-matcher@v1
      - run: echo "Run some tests that will be picked up"
      - uses: xt0rted/problem-matcher@v1
        with:
          action: remove
      - run: echo "Run some more tests that shouldn't be picked up"
```
